TradeBlock analysts drew attention to the continued increase in BTC hashrate for seven consecutive days. Among experts, there is an opinion that an increase in hashrate in the Bitcoin network usually precedes a more active increase in the price of cryptocurrency. Researchers identify two main factors contributing to the activation of miners. Firstly, this is the introduction of a qualitatively new mining equipment. Secondly, the rainy season has begun in China. At this time of the year, in China, in some provinces, prices for electricity generated by hydropower plants are reduced. /// BinaryMan /// 08/07/2020 /// 1
Cardano (ADA) grew by 40% in a week, moving Litecoin to 7th place in the list of largest cryptocurrencies of CoinGecko portal. ADA growth has been seen amid preparations for the launch of the Shelley update on the core network. It will be held on July 29 and, as expected, will significantly increase the decentralization of the blockchain. /// Ziggyyyy /// 09/07/2020 /// 1
The computing power of the Bitcoin network is very high, but judging by the meager commissions for transfers of hundreds of millions of dollars, demand is now low. Bitcoin consumes a huge amount of resources, but it works almost “idle”. It cannot last long. /// Ilari0000n /// 12/06/2020 /// 0
ETC hasn’t shown any significant movement in the last 6 months. All indicators are pointing to a large ETC pump, and this coincides with the potential for an ETH pump as well. Both ETH and ETC generally move in tandem, so it’s critical to watch both of these projects. Although ETC doesn’t have the awareness, community, or lasting power that ETH does, it’s nonetheless a hedge against such an obvious bet. If you load up on ETC here, you’ll be ahead of the herd in profiting a large amount off of this next pump coin. There aren’t many chances to make huge profits at the moment, but ETC is looking like the prime choice. /// Gerald /// 03/06/2020 /// 1
After halving, many holders think that the price of bitcoin should be much higher than the current one. Because of this, there is a tendency to hold the asset until the market starts to accelerate again. /// 1TrenT1 /// 28/05/2020 /// 1
Despite the approach of halving, it is still difficult to see the signs of FOMO in the market dynamics, which can drive the price far above $ 10,000. And the closer the halving, the less chance it will happen. Bitcoin runs the risk of depreciating multiple times in the coming months if it falls below the 200-day moving average ($ 8,000). /// RealSatoshi /// 12/05/2020 /// 0
Halving is now the main trigger for the cryptocurrency market, and most participants expect a positive impact. However, there are fears that the upcoming halving is already taken into account in the price of bitcoin, and there is a possibility of a sharp collapse shortly before or immediately after the event. /// OrdinaryBillionaire /// 10/05/2020 /// 0
I hate to say it, but I think Cardano isn’t going anywhere. Ever since the ADA summit, i think investors are very disappointed with not only the zero news, but lack of professionalism. At the end of the summit, Charles even committed animal abuse with the box full of butterflies. I don’t think any CEO on this planet would ever try to pull such a ridiculous stunt, and it lost a lot of credibility for the project. ADA will fall out of the top ten as the market continues to decide who stays and who must go. /// RalphtheKing /// 27/04/2020 /// 0
Bitcoin COT report data reflects the rise in bullish sentiment among large speculators. Large funds continued to increase their positions in the last week. Purchases were increased by 6%, sales - by 2%, which led to a decrease in the net position for a decrease in BTC by 12%. At the same time, the net position again approached the minimum levels for the last 3.5 months. The continuation of this trend may contribute to the growth of the cryptocurrency. The number of large buyers increased by 4, to 41 over the week. At the same time, the number of large sellers increased by 2, to 29. New market participants are arriving, and the situation is gradually becoming less bearish. Small speculators mainly reduced their purchases last week, which have decreased by 8%. Small speculators were marked by an increase in bearish sentiment, but this group of traders usually does not have a significant impact on the market. /// Shantanio /// 19/07/2020 /// 1
Among altcoins, it is worth highlighting Ethereum, which shows more than a twofold growth in the number of active wallets since the beginning of the year, several times ahead of Bitcoin in this indicator. In this case, this growth can be influenced by both DeFi (decentralized financial applications), as well as the work of other altcoins (including stablecoins) based on the Ethereum platform. Since the beginning of the year, the price of ETH has increased by 79%, which also reflects the confidence of market participants in the development of the platform's ecosystem. /// PancakeKing ///  17/07/2020 /// 1
In addition to cryptocurrencies with low capitalization, Ethereum is a serious competitor to bitcoin. According to Messari, the growth in the number of active wallets of the leading altcoin is several times higher than Bitcoin and is 118% since the beginning of the year. Demand for DeFi is becoming the next growth driver, creating the basis for the purchase of tokens not only for speculative purposes. Just this was not enough bitcoin to steadily overcome $ 10K. /// Copernicus8394 /// 15/07/2020 /// 1
The current sideways trading has been going on for 2.5 months, and this is quite a lot for the cryptocurrency market. In the case of bitcoin, no matter how volatile the asset may be in the short and medium term, in the long-term format, the digital currency shows growth. Since the beginning of 2020, bitcoin has grown by 29%. Over the past 3 years, almost threefold growth. /// Torsten ///  14/07/2020 /// 1
The demand for altcoins such as ETH is growing, as it has become corny easier to buy. Many applications have been released where in a few clicks you can buy almost all altcoins from the TOP-100, paying for it with a credit card. Inside applications, as a rule, there are ways to instantly take profits in USDT stablecoin, and then withdraw to fiat. This is a significant difference from the situation in 2017, when purchase schemes for retail investors were rather confusing. /// PancakeKing /// 10/07/2020 /// 1
COT Bitcoin reporting data reflects bearish sentiment among major speculators. Large funds last week actively increased their positions after a month of expiration of futures. Sales increased by 9%, purchases - by 6%, which led to an increase in the net position for a decrease in BTC by 21%. At the same time, the net position began to grow from the levels minimal over the past three months. A continuation of this trend may contribute to a decrease in cryptocurrency. /// ArchGabriel /// 12/07/2020 /// 0
Institutional acceptance and awareness of this asset class is growing on the bitcoin market, which should positively affect the appreciation in the long term. BTC is starting to look attractive as a new asset class that is not prone to printing money by central banks. /// GeoTagsOff /// 10/07/2020 /// 1
